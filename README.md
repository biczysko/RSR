2. Explanation  for the files in the https://github.com/biczysko/RSR/tree/master/3j63_tc_refine

In this refinement computations stoped due to hardware problems in weight search after weight 10.
I did not want to repeat all again, so I have modified code and started again from weight 10 (I actually thought it will fail ...).
The first computations are in the log_00 file and next ones in log. Also duplicated weight search pdbs have suffix 00 in case of first computations.
